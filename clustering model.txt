In easy and medium bach all wires are distinct, separate entities so Agglomerative clustering might be efficient since we can include connectivity constraints

In hard bach ther are some loss in connectivity so the previous solutions might not work as well anymore.

Then in extra hard loss in connectivity happen less often than in hard.
